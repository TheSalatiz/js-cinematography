    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
      My name is Juan Salazar, and I’m a Colombian filmmaker, visual storyteller, and multimedia artist with a deep love for cinematic expression and a dream bigger than myself.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mt-4">
      I recently completed my degree in Film, Multimedia, and Production in the United States, where I’ve grown as a cinematographer, editor, and Director. For me, filmmaking is more than visuals — it’s about connection, identity, and purpose. Each frame I compose, each project I take on, is shaped by a desire to move people and represent truth with emotional clarity.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mt-4">
      My work reflects both technical skill and personal vision — blending natural light, intentional composition, and intuitive storytelling. Whether I’m directing a cinematic diary, crafting a short film, or capturing the energy of a live event, I strive to deliver content that resonates.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mt-4">
      As an international artist, I carry not just my camera, but my family’s hopes. I’m motivated by the dream of building a fulfilling life through meaningful work — and giving back to those who helped me get here.
