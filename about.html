    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
      JS Cinematography is led by Juan Salazar — a Colombian-born filmmaker, visual storyteller, and multimedia artist currently based in the U.S. As a soon-to-be graduate in Film, Multimedia, and Production, Juan blends emotional authenticity with cinematic visuals to tell stories that connect and move people.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mt-4">
      Juan’s journey is shaped by a dream greater than himself — to support his family, honor his roots, and leave behind meaningful, visually compelling work. Whether through film, photography, or AI-enhanced media, his mission is to capture depth, light, and soul.
